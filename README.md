## How To Config index.html  
  
In your webpack.common.js :  
  
```javascript  
{...}  
 new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ inject: true,    
 title: 'React-Webpack', //your website title    
 favicon: 'src/common/images/favicon.ico',  //your favicon  
  meta: {  //your meta tags  
  viewport: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0',    
 description: 'React 16 + Webpack 4 + Fontawesome + Ant-Design + Hotreolad'    
  },    
 minify: true, // minify your index.html {true,false}  
 }) ],  
{...}  
```

## Chunk & Compression

### Compression
Compressed versions of assets to serve them with Content-Encoding by [`compression-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/compression-webpack-plugin)

in webpack.prod.js :
```javascript
{...}
new CompressionPlugin({  
    asset: "[path].gz[query]",  
  algorithm: "gzip",  
  test: /\.js$|\.css$|\.html$/,  
  threshold: 10240, //Only assets bigger than this size are processed. In bytes.  
  minRatio: 0.8  
})
{...}
```

### Chunk (Code Splitting)
Code splitting is one of the most compelling features of webpack. This feature allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. It can be used to achieve smaller bundles and control resource load prioritization which, if used correctly, can have a major impact on load time... [MORE DETAILS](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)

in webpack.prod.js :
```javascript
{...}
output: {  
  path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),  
  filename: '[name].[hash].js',  
  chunkFilename: '[name].[hash].js',  // output Filename
},
optimization: {  
  runtimeChunk: false,  
  splitChunks: {  
    cacheGroups: {  
      commons: {  
        test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,  
	    name: 'vendors',  
	    chunks: 'all',  
        },  
    },  
  }  
},
{...}
```
